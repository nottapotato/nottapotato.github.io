<p><small> You and your merry little band of fellow organic nonGMO potato farmers decided to sit and cry. As you make your way to the fields to sob, a storm starts to brew to fit the mood of the game.</small></p>
    
<p><small>Over the crashing thunder and lightning you can hear screaming and shouting for your group to stop. The rain has soaked you to the bone. In the distance police sirens can be heard. A crash of thunder, and suddenly lightning. Because you and your band of fellow organic nonGMO potato farmers were the only ones outside, soaked to the bone in rain, the lightning goes straight to you and electrocutes you all.

    <p><strong> You have died.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><strong>The End.</strong></strong></p>
